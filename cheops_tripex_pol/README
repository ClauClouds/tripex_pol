now the two scripts change{..}.py came into play after I had already reprocessed the LV0 data. 
The problem is that the original w-band data has the H and V channel names switched up. 
In order to not having to reprocess everything, I just quickly wrote these skripts to just 
change the names of the variables, so that H and V are assigned to the correct channels.

The folder ghostEchoFiltering_HPC is directly copied from cheops to here, so those are the 
routines that are running on cheops and are used to reprocess the LV0 files and calculate the LV1 moments.
