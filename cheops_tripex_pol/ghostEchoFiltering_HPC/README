This folder was used to reprocess the triple frequency dataset from the tripex-pol campaign. 
The main skript that does all the work is ghostEchoFilteringLeonie.py. In order to run it on cheops you have to use the bash scripts batch_process_day.sh and batch_send_days.sh

The chain of reprocessing is:

1) regrid everything to a common grid (the skripts that are doing that are regridGhostecho.py and readData.py) 
2) remove the GhostEchos (needed here is createEmptyDataset.py, regridGhostecho.py, process.py, processX.py, kaLib.py). The ghostEchos are removed by getting the fastest and slowest edge of the Ka-Spectrum and cutting the W-Band spectrum at those velocities. For consitency: the X-Band spectra are also cut there
3) calculate the moments from the new spectra (needed here is moments.py)
